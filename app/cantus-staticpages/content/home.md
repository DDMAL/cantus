## Welcome to Cantus Ultimus
The main objective of this research is to incorporate the latest optical music recognition (OMR) technologies with plainchant manuscripts in order to transform the existing [CANTUS](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/) database into a state-of-the-art research environment in which both music and text are fully searchable.

This research is part of the [SIMSSA project](http://www.simssa.ca/).
