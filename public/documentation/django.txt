Makemigration is like commit, migrate is like push

right now
localhost:8000/manuscripts/ is the main page, should remove the index page at some point so 
localhost:8000/ points to this page.

python manage.py flush to clear all tables and data in database
got an error, removed migrations folder and makemigrations again


removed Page, so manuscript details shows a list of chants, and we can get the folio number from diva image and search through solr
to get a list of chants for a particulat page.

removed Feast and Concordance from the models too because all these fields will only get expanded when they are stored in solr.
