To incorporate diva in the django application:

Copy js, css, img folders from DIVA_HOME/build to cantus/static

Need to startup fastcgi in the django project

pip install flup

to check the options: python manage.py runfcgi help

can only see the manuscript list page, manuscript detail can't display diva part

in nginx erro log:
WSGIServer: missing FastCGI param SERVER_PORT required by WSGI!

Add
        fastcgi_param SERVER_ADDR $server_addr;
        fastcgi_param SERVER_PORT $server_port;
        fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME $server_name;
        fastcgi_param SERVER_PROTOCOL $server_protocol;

        in localhost.conf

created 2 conf files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/site-enabled
one for django and one for diva. (see django.conf and localhost.conf in nginx_conf.txt)

Run a fastcgi server on a UNIX domain socket 
create a socket file django.sock in /var/run/supervisor/
instead of running the django development server,
python manage.py runfcgi method=prefork socket=/var/run/supervisor/django.sock
