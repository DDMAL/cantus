Install IIPImage on the machine (not in a specific virtualenv)

Brew install nginx
Brew install supervisor

http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#fcgi-program-x-section-settings

To start or stop nginx
Brew services start(restart/stop) nginx

Error log : /usr/local/var/log/nginx
check log : tail -fn0 error.log
Modified the config files:

/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
/usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/localhost.conf
/usr/local/etc/supervisor/conf.d/iipserver.conf

iipserver running
http://localhost:8080/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi
/usr/local/share/iipimage/iipsrv.fcgi



convert the images for DIVA:

for st-gallen, use images in
Gershwin: Shared2/St_Gallen/images(raw)/highres PNG

Process.py convert images to tiff then to jpeg2000 using kdu_compress script

brew libtool
brew uninstall libpng, png, libtiff, imagemagick
brew install libpng jpeg libtiff
brew install (–force) imagemagic
in /Users/weigao/Documents/development/diva.js/build/processing
/process.py, changed 
PATH_TO_KDU_COMPRESS = "/usr/bin/kdu_compress"

using the process.py to convert  high resolution png to tiff
python process.py -t jpeg /Users/weigao/Documents/development/divatest/testing testout testout-json

kdu_compress can’t read tiff, needs another version

assume we have tiff images, they work with Iipimage.

Django running on localhost:8000
Nginx + iipserver on localhost:8080


Diva in Django:
copied js, css, img folders from diva.js/build to cantus/static

Proxy with nginx to serve both iipserver and django
Localhost:8080/iipserver connects to iipserver
Localhost:8080/ serves diva demo index page
Localhost:8080/diva/ should do the same but doesn’t work


TO DO: 
image processing? Get complete data?
