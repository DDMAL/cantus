The IIP Image Server, a highly optimized image server;\n2. A `.json` file containing measurement data about the image collection, used by the front-end component to determine the layout of the viewer;\n3. A JavaScript and HTML front-end component used to display the images in a browser.\n\nYour document image files must be processed into either Pyramid TIFF or JPEG2000 format in order to be served by IIP. We provide [a script](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/wiki/Preparing-Your-Images) to easily do this.\n\n### Details\n\nThe IIP Image Server is required by Diva to serve image data. IIP creates the image tiles and other image representations \"on the fly\". Instructions for building and installing IIP are available on the [project's website](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/documentation/server/). If you want to support JPEG 2000 you will either need to download a pre-compiled version (available on the [Old Maps Online site](http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000/installation)) or [purchase the Kakadu libraries](http://www.kakadusoftware.com) and build it yourself.\n\nDiva relies on a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that contains data about your document. This JSON file is automatically generated when you use the image conversion scripts that we distribute with Diva. These files can be served using a regular web server. _(If you used previous versions of Diva, we had a dedicated `divaserve` script to do this. This dependency has been removed in version 3.0)_.\n\nDownload the [latest release](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/releases) of Diva. In the `diva.js` directory (or `build` if you have the source code) you can find a pre-compiled version of Diva. The `css`, `js` and `img` directories contain the files necessary to use Diva. You will also find a number of demos and some helper scripts for processing your image files.\n\nThere are two image formats supported by IIP: Pyramid TIFF and, with the inclusion of the Kakadu libraries, JPEG2000. These formats support multiple file resolutions and image tiling. \n\n## Installing\n\nThe most basic Diva viewer is instantiated with three required parameters:\n\n```javascript\n\n$('#diva-wrapper').diva({\n    iipServerURL: \"http://www.example.com/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi\",\n    objectData: \"http://www.example.com/beromunster.json\",\n    imageDir: \"/mnt/images/beromunster\"\n});\n```\n\n * `iipServerURL`: The URL to your IIP installation. In most cases this should point to the iipsrv.fcgi file;\n * `objectData`: The URL (absolute or relative) to the document's `.json` file\n * `imageDir`: Either the absolute path to your images on your server, OR the path relative to your IIP installation's [`FILESYSTEM_PREFIX`](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/documentation/server/) configuration option.\n\nThe `#diva-wrapper` selector points to a `div` element where you want the scrollable page images to appear.\n\nSince IIP will be serving the images you should not place your images in directory accessible by your web server. In other words, if your web server uses `/srv/www` as its root directory you do not need to place your images there -- they can reside in any directory on your server as long as it they can be read by the IIP instance.\n\nSee [Installation](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/wiki/Installation) for full instructions.\n#### Cross-site Requests\n\nYou may receive an error that looks something like this:\n\n```\nXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://example.com/demo/imagefiles.json. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access.\n```\n\nThis is a security precaution that all browsers use to prevent cross-site request forgeries. If you receive this message it is because your `objectData` parameter and the server used to serve the Diva page are not at the same server address.\n\nTo fix this you must ensure that the Diva HTML page, and the location pointed to by the `objectData` page are being served by the same server, or you must create an exception using the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on your server to explicitly white-list the `objectData` location.\n\n### Running the Demos\n\nRunning the demos works best using a web server. The easiest is to use Python to start a small web server in the `diva.js` directory (or `build` if you have the source code):\n\n```\n$> cd diva-v3.0.0/diva.js/ # (or cd diva.js/build)\n$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...\n```\nYou may then load the demos in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.\n\n## Building from source\n\nIf you wish to install from source, you can check out the code from [our GitHub repository](http://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js). To fully build Diva you will need the following dependencies:\n\n * the [LESS stylesheet compiler](http://lesscss.org)\n * the [Closure Javascript compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/)\n\nAll other dependencies are listed above.\n\nThe full installation gives you access to the un-minified JavaScript source, the plugins, the documentation, and our unit-tests. We use a build script (`build.sh`) for basic development tasks:\n\n * `./build.sh less`: Compiles and minifies the LESS files into CSS.\n * `./build.sh minify`: Minifies the JavaScript files using the Closure compiler.\n * `./build.sh all`: Performs both less and minify. (Also copies relevant source files to the build directory.)\n * `./build.sh test`: Runs Diva's unit tests with [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).\n * `./build.sh release VERSION`: Builds the release package. `VERSION` is the release name, so `./build.sh release 3.0.0` will create `diva-3.0.0.tar.gz`. \n\nSee [Installation](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/wiki/Installation) for more information.\n\n### Getting help\n\nHelp for diva.js is available through this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/wiki), in the form of code documentation, installation instructions and usage tips.\n\nLet Us Know\n-----------\n\nWe're developing Diva.js as part of our research in [Distributed Digital Music Libraries](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca). If you use it in your project, it would be great if you could [let us know](mailto:andrew.hankinson@mail.mcgill.ca).\n",
